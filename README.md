This repository is going to house all of the final projects for the courses in my Udacity Data Streaming Nanodegree program.

Learn how to process data in real-time by building fluency in modern data engineering tools, such as Apache Spark, Kafka, Spark Streaming, and Kafka Streaming. 
You’ll start by understanding the components of data streaming systems. You’ll then build a real-time analytics application. 
Students will also compile data and run analytics, as well as draw insights from reports generated by the streaming console.
